55,disasters,IN,"The residents of Delhi woke up to a thick blanket of smog this morning amid warnings by weather officials of falling air quality in the national capital two days before Diwali. The levels of the pollutant PM2.5 was at a ""hazardous"" 644 or over 20 times the safe limit prescribed by the WHO this morning at south Delhi's Okhla, according to data from the Delhi Pollution Control Board. PM2.5 are fine particles that can penetrate the lungs and cause respiratory diseases. Visibility on the roads was low this morning, as against Sunday when air quality significantly improved due to increased wind speed and control measures implemented by the government. Smog kills more than one million Indians every year and Delhi has the worst air of any major city on the planet, the World Health Organisation says. ""As expected, there is a significant biomass pollution in Delhi, which has placed air quality in the very poor category despite moderate surface wind speed,"" said an official with the center-run System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research or SAFAR. The contribution of stubble-burning to pollution in the national capital is expected to be 24 percent today, another weather official said. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology also said stubble-burning and other sources of air pollution in the northwest region of India were significantly less on Saturday compared to Thursday last but warned of a sharp increase in PM2.5 concentration from today. ""If significant-stubble burning continues... in the NW (north-west) region, then its impact is very likely over Delhi and AQI may reach the upper end of the very poor category,"" the IITM said. The DPCC has directed the transport department and the traffic police to intensify checking of polluting vehicles and control road congestion till November 10. Construction work involving excavation is banned; no stone-crushers and hot-mix plants that generate dust cannot be run at this time. ""I have sent my children to play outside after weeks (on Sunday). I hope the air quality finally improves and we see a clean Diwali,"" Mayur Vihar resident Sarita Mathur told PTI.

Firefighters, police and ambulances were seen responding to the site of Quality Concrete on MacDonald Avenue after a loud blast was heard around 3:20 p.m. Halifax Fire said the roof blew off a silo, sending concrete dust and other debris into the air. ""Windows were shuddering all over the neighbourhood and there was a huge plume of smoke emanating from the building,"" said division fire Chief Stephen Nearing. The cause of the explosion still wasn't known as of early Monday evening. Nearing said the air quality would be tested. He said fly ash is known to be a carcinogen, but it's unclear how much harm it poses in the Burnside area. ""We're lucky that it's not very windy today so I think they will develop a plan to ensure that all the debris and all the dust is cleaned up as quickly as possible before any rains or winds pick up,"" he said.

99,disasters,US,"Deputies forced their way into a smoke-filled room at the Sonoma County Jail Monday morning and subdued an inmate who authorities said barricaded himself inside, threatened jail staff and started a fire by sticking an object into an electrical outlet. The incident sent the inmate, identified as Bernabe Martinez Ramirez, 16 jail staff members and four other inmates to the hospital for smoke inhalation, Sonoma County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Spencer Crum said. In February, Ramirez, 27, was placed into a segregated jail housing unit after he allegedly stabbed another inmate with a hairbrush that was filed to a sharp point, resulting in an attempted murder charge, Crum said. He was originally booked into jail in connection with a June 2017 case that resulted in felony charges of hit and run, obstructing police and attempting to take a gun from an officer. Inmates like Ramirez are moved into such housing units when they engage in bad behavior such as getting into fights or when they are a risk to staff members, Crum said. They have no physical contact with other inmates, though they can talk to each other from their cells. Trouble at the jail started at about 9 a.m., when Ramirez was alone and taking a scheduled break near his cell in a common room, where inmates segregated from the others have access one by one to amenities like a TV, a bathroom and phone, Crum said. Deputies noticed Ramirez was tying bed sheets from one door handle to the next, preventing them from opening doors into the room, Crum said. He also covered the room's floor with soap and pried a manual pencil sharpener off a wall and put it into a sock, using it to threaten correctional staff that watched from a window nearby. ""The deputies weren't going to charge in there and possibly get injured,"" Crum said. A crisis negotiation team was called in and team members spent about 40 minutes trying to talk with him. Meanwhile, Ramirez grabbed toilet paper, another object which the Crum declined to disclose for security reasons, and used it to spark a fire from an electrical outlet. ""He's able to start a fire and he starts lighting a bunch of toilet paper, sheets and clothing on fire,"" Crum said, adding that Ramirez also broke down a wooden cabinet and added it to the flames. ""We're not going to disclose (the object) because we don't want to see this behavior continue with other inmates."" The smoke from the small fire activated the facility's sprinkler system, dousing the room with water. About 15 to 20 deputies stormed into the jail common area, taking Ramirez into custody and using fire extinguishers to put out the flames. The jail was placed on lockdown following the fire, keeping visitors from meeting with inmates. Santa Rosa firefighters initially dispatched to the jail for a medical aid call at 10:10 a.m. also helped put out the flames, learning of the incident as they were being escorted into the facility to treat an inmate, Santa Rosa fire Battalion Chief Mark Basque said. Sonoma County Sheriff's property investigators, which are trained in arson cases, will take the lead in the fire investigation, though Santa Rosa Fire Department investigators will help, Crum said.

121,disasters,GT,"Guatemala's Fuego (Fire) volcano located about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the capital, on Tuesday began erupting for the fourth time this year, after in June it entered an eruptive phase during which at least 190 people died. In a special bulletin, the Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology Institute said that weak and moderate explosions were occurring in the cone, producing a column of ash 4,800 meters (15,750 feet) high. In addition, over the crater there have been two incandescent pulses rising up 300 meters. The fire mountain, rising 3,763 meters above sea level and located on the mutual border of Escuintla, Chimaltenango and Sacatepequez provinces, on June 3 produced one of the most powerful eruptions in recorded history, killing at least 190 people, along with an additional 238 people who disappeared without a trace and in all likelihood also perished. The eruptive phase that began on Tuesday, which has already resulted in a fine rain of ash falling onto the villages of Panimache, El Porvenir, Morelia, Santa Sofia, Sangre de Cristo and Pedro Yepocapa, is causing ""weak and moderate"" avalanches around the crater. The institute said that there are ""lava flows 1,000 meters (long) heading in the direction of the Ceniza ravine"" and weak rumbling and shockwaves are causing roofs and windows in structures in the area to rattle and vibrate.

187,disasters,CA,"Five cars of a freight train carrying an industrial chemical derailed in Toronto early Sunday, but no one was injured and nothing harmful was leaked, according to CN and a federal official. Three of the derailed cars contained vinyl acetate, but the chemical was not spilled, according to Julie Leroux, spokesperson for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Two derailed cars were carrying grain and only the one carrying rice leaked, she added. The federal government says the chemical, not considered harmful to human health, is used in the production of latex paints, adhesives, sealant material and glues. It is found in cosmetics, personal care products and food packaging. Emergency crews were called to the scene of the derailment on Kennedy Road, south of Eglinton Avenue East, in Scarborough, Toronto's easternmost district, at about 2:43 a.m. ET. Firefighters found the cars off the tracks and they tried to determine whether any harmful material had spilled, according to Capt. Adrian Ratushniak, spokesperson for Toronto Fire Services. They found nothing harmful had spilled, he added. Firefighters then created a ""safe perimeter"" of about 300 metres surrounding the derailment to contain the scene before handing it over to CN staff, Ratushniak told CBC Toronto. ""There is no threat. There is no danger. And there were no injuries at the scene. At this time, our fire crews have cleared."" About 25 firefighters and six trucks responded to the call, he said. Jonathan Abecassis, spokesperson for CN, said in a statement that CN is investigating the derailment. ""Current reports indicate that five cars have derailed in various positions, that there are no injuries or release of any dangerous goods and that the train is blocking a crossing on Kennedy Road,"" he said. ""We regret any impact this incident may have on local residents."" That train has since been removed and the roadway has been reopened, according to Toronto police. The cause of the derailment hasn't been determined. Const. David Hopkinson, spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service, said they were told there was ""hazardous material"" on the train and police were ready to evacuate the area, but nothing leaked from the derailed cars and an evacuation was not necessary.

216,disasters,FI,"Officials in south-west Finland have pinpointed the source of radiation detected from a load of scrap metal in the municipality of Eurajoki, site of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant. They determined that the radiation source is a device probably used to measure soil moisture and density. ""Based on the pictures I have received, it is a relatively rare, old device,"" says Santtu Hellsten, a section head at the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) told Yle on Tuesday morning. Later in the day STUK announced that the instrument was identified as one used by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) in the 1970s. Hellsten tells Yle that the recycling firm acted properly by contacting STUK after detecting radiation in a load of waste.  STUK asked the local rescue squad to measure the radiation level at the site and then declared that it did not pose any danger to people or the environment. On Monday STUK sent two experts to investigate in Eurajoki, some 40 km south of Pori. They continued their work on Tuesday. ""This is quite rare. These [cases] come up every couple of years, maybe even less frequently,"" said Hellsten. He says this was clearly a case of careless disposal of a radiation source. ""This kind of device requires a safety permit as it contains a radiation source. It emits some radiation into its immediate vicinity, but is no danger to anyone who is further away,"" Hellsten explains. At the moment there are about 100 soil moisture meters or hygrometers listed in STUK's safety registry. However the permit for the device in question expired years ago. ""It is a relief that the origin of the device will not remain a mystery,"" Hellsten said after the item's provenance became clear. ""The user of the device is responsible for its disposal, so now we know who will pay for the costs."" The meter apparently ended up in a waste container during renovation of the SYKE headquarters in Helsinki, and was transferred for processing at the Eurajoen Romu recycling facility - which is coincidentally about 20 km from the Olkiluoto nuclear plant, where all radioactive waste is now stored in a temporary facility. In cases where the origin of such items cannot be determined, the state is responsible for its disposal. Alternately the item may be returned to the importer or manufacturer. The case may still spark a police investigation.

224,disasters,US,"Airplane passengers on their way to Southwest Florida International Airport received a big scare when their plane was forced to turn around and head back to Pittsburgh. Passenger Bill Puschaver says he was sitting on board when he heard an unfamiliar noise. ""It felt like the landing gear was making a loud noise, like it malfunctioning,"" Puschaver said. A few rows behind Puschaver, sat Mary Fensel, who says she heard the same thing but saw an interesting sight outside her window. ""It was really crazy, but they said, 'Hey, we hit a flock of geese,'"" Fensel said. Shortly after taking off from Pittsburgh International Airport, the Southwest Airlines flight hit a bird and the pilot turned the plane around to make an emergency landing at the Pittsburgh airport. The flight then landed safely without incident in Pittsburgh International Airport, said a Southwest Airlines spokesperson. The aircraft was then removed from service for a maintenance inspection.

224,disasters,US,"Airplane passengers on their way to Southwest Florida International Airport received a big scare when their plane was forced to turn around and head back to Pittsburgh. Passenger Bill Puschaver says he was sitting on board when he heard an unfamiliar noise. ""It felt like the landing gear was making a loud noise, like it malfunctioning,"" Puschaver said. A few rows behind Puschaver, sat Mary Fensel, who says she heard the same thing but saw an interesting sight outside her window. ""It was really crazy, but they said, 'Hey, we hit a flock of geese,'"" Fensel said. Shortly after taking off from Pittsburgh International Airport, the Southwest Airlines flight hit a bird and the pilot turned the plane around to make an emergency landing at the Pittsburgh airport. The flight then landed safely without incident in Pittsburgh International Airport, said a Southwest Airlines spokesperson. The aircraft was then removed from service for a maintenance inspection.

230,disasters,US,"A tour bus overturned on an icy highway southeast of Memphis on Wednesday afternoon, leaving two people dead and injuring all 44 others aboard as a storm blasted parts of the South with sleet and light snow, authorities said. Sgt. Joey Miller with the Mississippi Highway Patrol Troop E said in a statement that the bus traveling from Huntsville, Alabama, to Tunica County, Mississippi, crashed at 12:35 p.m. on Interstate 269 in the northern part of the state. His statement called the crash ""weather-related"" but didn't elaborate, though he said the 44 hurt were taken to several hospitals with an array of injuries. The bus was operated by Teague VIP Express, located in Anniston, Alabama. The company posted a message on its Facebook page that said: ""Our hearts and prayers go out to victims of this tragedy. Please keep everyone involved and families in your prayers."" The red tour bus with white and gray stripes was being towed later Wednesday from the crash site. The bus windows appeared mostly missing or shattered and a smell of gasoline hung in the air. Large scratches and other damage were visible on the driver's side as workers cleared the highway of debris. The company has only three buses and three drivers, according to licensing information from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and it hasn't had any crashes in the last two years. A hospital spokeswoman, Ayoka Pond, said 19 passengers were transported from the crash site near Byhalia to Baptist Memorial Hospital-DeSoto in Southaven, Mississippi, and three of them were in serious condition there. She said seven others were taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital-Collierville in that Tennessee suburb of Memphis. An additional 18 passengers were taken to Methodist Hospital Olive Branch in that Mississippi city, said spokeswoman Mary Alice Taylor. The hospital couldn't immediately provide conditions of those patients. The identities of the dead and injured were not immediately released and it was not immediately clear the specific end destination of the bus in the Tunica area, a casino town in south Mississippi. It was the second charter bus excursion to a Mississippi casino town to end in fatalities in the last two years. A bus carrying Texas senior citizens to a Gulf Coast casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, got stuck on train tracks and was slammed by a freight train in March 2017. The crash resulted in four deaths and 38 injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board found that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of a railroad and the city to work together to improve the safety of a sharply humped railroad crossing, even though it was well known that vehicles occasionally got stuck there. NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said the federal agency hasn't determined yet whether it will investigate Wednesday's crash. On Wednesday, the Mississippi Department of Transportation reported icing on roads and bridges in 10 northern counties from the storm. A wintry mix of snow and sleet prompted some school, church and museum closings in west Tennessee during the day. After days of heavy rain and storms along a cold front, flurries left a thin layer of snow atop vehicles in western Mississippi overnight, and a Mississippi River bridge turned white in Greenville, Mississippi. Light snow or freezing rain was possible with no accumulations into northwest Alabama, forecasters said.",34.88791,-89.710611,90,2018-11-15T06:23:52Z,America/Chicago,Vehicle Accident - North-America - USA,2018-11-15,disaster

The incident at the sewage treatment plant on Sciota Street was first reported on Wednesday at 12:22 p.m., according to Erie County 911. The incident involved the wrong chemicals that were put into a storage tank at the facility, Corry City Manager Jason Biondi said. According to Brian Mesaros, Erie County's assistant emergency management coordinator, a chemical was added to another chemical and inadvertently caused a reaction that generated some chlorine gas. The case was contained to the building, and no one was injured, but the building was evacuated as a precaution, Mesaros said. Emergency responders, including the Erie County Hazardous Materials Response Team, were waiting late Wednesday afternoon for the company that delivered the chemicals to bring in a response team to pump the material out of the affected tank to several smaller tanks, rendering the chemicals harmless, Mesaros said.

252,disasters,PH,"Mayon volcano (Philippines): increasing activity, sporadic small explosions, crater glow. Weak activity has returned to the volcano and signs are increasing that it might be heading towards another eruption in a not-too-distant future. After a period of calm since the end of the most recent significant eruption during early 2018 and a few isolated explosions in May and June, at least 3 small explosions occurred over the past days, including at least one that was described as weak ""lava fountaining"", i.e. involved fresh lava arriving in the summit area.  Monitoring data suggest that new magma has been intruding deep beneath the surface, without much seismic activity, but detected by ongoing inflation of the edifice since late June 2018. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions are high. In today's bulletin, PHIVOLCS reported: ""an average of 1196 tonnes/day on 14 November 2018. Precise leveling data obtained on 22-31 October 2018 indicate inflation of the edifice in the southeast sector while the north sector indicate short-term deflation relative to 30 August to 3 September 2018. The volcano generally remains inflated relative to 2010 baselines. Electronic tilt data further show pronounced inflation of the mid-slopes beginning 25 June 2018, possibly due to aseismic magma intrusion deep beneath the edifice.""  Two small, short-lived eruptions occurred on 8 Nov at 12:43 and on 12 Nov at 07:39 local time. Brownish ash plumes were observed rising a few hundred meters and drifting WSW and SW. Since then, weak glow can be seen in the crater area, probably caused not by fresh lava in the summit crater but hot gasses escaping the conduit. According to PHIVOLCS, the explosions earlier this week were associated with a degassing events and there was no accompanying seismic or infrasound record. On 11 Nov, a volcanic earthquake was associated with a short-lived lava fountaining event at 08:40. The event lasted for 36 seconds based on the seismic record and produced a brownish-gray ash plume that drifted SW. Crater incandescence was visible most nights during 7-13 November. Alert Level 2 currently prevails over Mayon Volcano. This means that Mayon is at a moderate level of unrest. DOST-PHIVOLCS reminds the public that sudden explosions, lava collapses, pyroclastic density currents or PDCs and ashfall can still occur and threaten areas in the upper to middle slopes of Mayon. DOST-PHIVOLCS recommends that entry into the six kilometer-radius Permanent Danger Zone or PDZ and a precautionary seven kilometer-radius Extended Danger Zone or EDZ in the south-southwest to east-northeast sector, stretching from Anoling, Camalig to Sta. Misericordia, Sto. Domingo must be strictly prohibited. People residing close to these danger areas are also advised to observe precautions associated with rockfalls, PDCs and ashfall. Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano's summit as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from sudden explosions and PDCs may pose hazards to aircrafts.",13.254832,123.68611200000001,90,2018-11-16T04:33:29Z,Asia/Manila,Volcano Activity - Pacific Ocean - West - Philippines,2018-11-16,disaster

278,disasters,US,"An explosion Saturday at a hazardous waste site in southwestern Idaho killed one worker, injured three others and heavily damaged a building, officials said. US Ecology, which runs the site, said Monte ""Alex"" Green of Grand View, Idaho, died of his injuries from the explosion at 9:23 a.m. inside one of the buildings at the facility. Green was working as an equipment operator moving materials at the time of the accident, the company said. Three others received treatment for non-life threatening injuries, the company said. A total of 15 US Ecology employees were working during the time of the explosion. The facility is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boise. ""Most of the skin has been blown out, and much of the metal has been bent,"" Simon Bell, the company's vice president of operations and chief operating officer, said of the building. ""It would have been a large explosion based on the damage to the building."" There's no threat to the public, and emergency crews, including a hazardous materials team, were at the site, Owyhee County spokeswoman Angela Barkell said. The facility is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of the small town of Grand View, and about a mile from a highway. ""No immediate threat has been identified, and no evacuations have taken place,"" Barkell said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. Bell said employees were doing routine work at the time of the blast, but he didn't want to speculate on the cause. ""Since we had an explosion there was something out of the ordinary, and we will be fiercely focused on understanding what that is,"" he said. The company takes in contaminants such as arsenic, lead, zinc, cadmium and other metals that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has deemed hazardous and converts them to non-hazardous residues, minimizing the long-term risks of disposal. The company then buries them at the site, which Bell said is about 200 acres. Bell said the company is working with emergency responders by providing maps of the facility and where various hazardous wastes are being stored. Emergency officials said the building where the explosion occurred is used to process powdered magnesium products. Officials said a series of chemical reactions followed the initial blast. US Ecology Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Feeler issued a statement about the explosion. We are deeply saddened to confirm that there has been one fatality resulting from the accident at our Grand View, Idaho facility today,"" Feeler said. ""This is a tragedy that has been felt through the entire US Ecology family and the darkest day in US Ecology's 66-year history. The entire US Ecology family extends its deepest, heartfelt sympathy to the employees, family members, and loved ones affected by this tragic event. Our focus will now be helping our team members cope with this loss while conducting a thorough investigation and working with authorities as they close out their own investigation."" The three people who are being treated at hospitals and expected to recover. Bell said the company, which also has facilities in other states, has never had such a serious incident. ""Our focus is on the families of those affected by the accident, supporting the first responders, and making sure our employees are cared for and updated on what's happening in this process,"" he said in an earlier statement.",43.065401,-116.26408899999998,90,2018-11-18T14:18:55Z,America/Boise,Explosion - North-America - USA,2018-11-18,disaster

Bell said employees were doing routine work at the time of the blast, but he didn't want to speculate on the cause. ""Since we had an explosion there was something out of the ordinary, and we will be fiercely focused on understanding what that is,"" he said. The company takes in contaminants such as arsenic, lead, zinc, cadmium and other metals that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has deemed hazardous and converts them to non-hazardous residues, minimizing the long-term risks of disposal. The company then buries them at the site, which Bell said is about 200 acres. Bell said the company is working with emergency responders by providing maps of the facility and where various hazardous wastes are being stored. Emergency officials said the building where the explosion occurred is used to process powdered magnesium products. Officials said a series of chemical reactions followed the initial blast. US Ecology Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Feeler issued a statement about the explosion. We are deeply saddened to confirm that there has been one fatality resulting from the accident at our Grand View, Idaho facility today,"" Feeler said. ""This is a tragedy that has been felt through the entire US Ecology family and the darkest day in US Ecology's 66-year history. The entire US Ecology family extends its deepest, heartfelt sympathy to the employees, family members, and loved ones affected by this tragic event. Our focus will now be helping our team members cope with this loss while conducting a thorough investigation and working with authorities as they close out their own investigation."" The three people who are being treated at hospitals and expected to recover. Bell said the company, which also has facilities in other states, has never had such a serious incident. ""Our focus is on the families of those affected by the accident, supporting the first responders, and making sure our employees are cared for and updated on what's happening in this process,"" he said in an earlier statement.",43.065401,-116.26408899999998,90,2018-11-18T14:18:55Z,America/Boise,Explosion - North-America - USA,2018-11-18,explosion

308,disasters,PK,"Considering the high intensity of smog situation in the country, members of a Senate caucus, on Thursday, have decided to declare a smog national emergency. The smog level in the atmosphere has been on the rising side for the past few weeks and has reached to an alarming environmental situation in the country. The quality of air is particularly very poor in the provincial capital of Punjab, Lahore and slowly engulfing Karachi now. The air pollution in the country has reached an enormously dangerous level that has probed the Parliamentary caucus to agree on declaring a national emergency. The caucus has also requested the Senate Chairman to summon a meeting of the committee to address the issue at earliest. The meeting was held at the Parliament House in Islamabad that was chaired by the Senator of Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarian (PPPP), Sherry Rehman. On this occasion, the Environmental Activist Ahmed Rafay Alam along with his team briefed the caucus about the current situation of poor air quality and rising air pollution levels in the country. The environmental law experts also told the various causes of smog and possible remedies in this regard. Smog appears in the month of November and December every year on a regular basis that has made it almost the fifth season of the year. The levels of air pollution remain the same throughout the year, however, during this part of the year when the weather is cold; this pollution manifests itself as smog. The caucus was being told about the various causes of smog at the meeting in detail. Chemical emissions from industries and factories, dust from ongoing construction projects, smoke from vehicles and the burning of crops are the major contributors towards intensifying air pollution and thus causing smog. A number of life-threatening diseases like lungs cancer and respiratory issues may appear if continuously exposed to smog conditions. Particularly children and elder people suffering from asthma are more likely to get affected by the smog conditions. There is a significant increase observed in such patients in the last few weeks and can rise if the situation persists. In response to the above briefing, the caucus expressed solid determination in bringing environmental reforms in the industrial and automobile sector of the country. All possible measures will be taken in order to change the energy policy and keeping a check on the industries. A number of effective policy measures will be taken to help fight against this environmental crisis. Moreover, the caucus laid stress the importance of installation of smog level measuring meters across the country which will help to tackle the smog situation with constructive planning.",30.464132,70.169467,90,2018-11-20T04:21:56Z,Asia/Karachi,Environment Pollution - Asia - Pakistan,2018-11-20,disaster

The planes with a total of at least 274 people on board came dangerously close to within 650 ft in height after a pilot 'error'. The near miss was on Monday evening and is reported to have involved planes from Russian carriers Aeroflot and Rossiya. Accounts say the incident involved an Aeroflot A-320 from Kaliningrad to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport and an A-319 Rossiya plane from St Petersburg to another city airport, Vnukovo. 'One of the plane's pilots erroneously started descending after he received a message from an air traffic controller that was addressed to the other aircraft,' reported a source cited by Interfax news agency. 'As a result, the crew were in a potentially hazardous condition involving a plane on a collision course. 'The vertical spacing between two liners shortened to 200 meters.' An alarm signal was activated on board the aircraft, said the source from air traffic control. Emergency procedures by the pilots prevented an appalling crash, it is understood. Blame has been put on the Aeroflot crew for acting on an instruction to descend that was intended for the other aircraft. 'The aircraft courses were traversed, the aircraft became dangerously close,' said a report on Mash Telegram. 'The A-320 reported that its collision avoidance system worked.' The incident was at 22.35 Moscow time (19.35 GMT). Reports said there were up to 180 on board the Aeroflot plane and up to 156 on the other aircraft. At least 274 passengers and crew were on both aircraft.

330,terror,IN,"Three people and over 20 injured when two motorcycle-borne men threw grenade on a religious congregation on city outskirts here on Sunday, an incident which the police are treating as a ""terrorist act"". The incident took place inside the Nirankari Bhavan's prayer hall at Adliwal village near Amritsar's Rajasansi, police said. A congregation of the Nirankari followers was being held inside at the time. The Sant Nirankari Mission is a spiritual organisation and the Bhavan here is located close to the international airport and Indo-Pak border. The grenade was lobbed by one of the two people who had their faces covered. One person pointed a gun at the volunteers manning the gate, while the other one hurled the bomb after which they escaped, police and eyewitnesses said. DGP Suresh Arora, who along with senior officers rushed to the spot, said police was treating it as a ""terrorist act"". Chief Minister Amarinder Singh condemned the attack and said the possibility of the involvement of ISI-based Khalistani/Kashmiri terror groups could not be ruled out. The DGP said three people had died in the incident and 20 were injured, two of them seriously, he said. The police said the grenade was hurled towards the stage where main preacher Sukhdev Kumar was holding the congregation. He was among the dead. The other deceased were Sandeep Singh, a resident of village Rajasansi, and Kuldeep Singh. Nine women and a six-year-old child were among the injured, they said. An FIR was registered based on the statement of Nirnakari sect volunteer Gagan, who was on duty at the main door of the premises. Inspector General of Police (Amritsar Border range) SPS Parmar, who visited the spot, said about 200 devotees, including women, were inside at the time of the incident. They had gathered for the congregation held each Sunday. No CCTV was installed at the premises, preliminary probe found, he said. SSP (Rural) Parampal Singh said two armed masked persons forced their way inside by pointing a gun at Arjan and Gagan, who were on duty at the gate. ""After they gained entry, one of them threw a grenade-like object at the congregation and escaped,"" he said, adding a hunt is on to nab the accused. After the incident, the Bhavan was sealed by the police and security was stepped up at other ""Nirankari Bhavans"" in the state. While Punjab was already on high alert, vigil has been stepped up in the state, especially border districts, including Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Ferozepur. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh Monday announced a reward of Rs 50 lakh for anybody providing information on those involved in the Amritsar grenade blast that left three persons dead, officials said. Information can be provided on the Punjab Police helpline - 181, officials said, adding the identity of the informer will be kept a secret.

395,disasters,SY,"At least 50 Syrian civilians are being treated following a suspected gas attack in the government-held city of Aleppo that state media has blamed on rebels. Most of those admitted to hospitals on Saturday in the northern region of the war-torn country had breathing problems and blurred vision, doctors told state TV. One doctor said two were in critical condition, including a child. State TV showed footage of medical professionals treating men and women on hospital beds. There was a stench of gas in Aleppo after projectiles were fired, said Rami Abdurrahman, the head of Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In Aleppo, the local governor Hussein Diab visited the injured at the hospital and told state TV that 41 people had been admitted. He accused rebels of using poisonous gas in the missiles they lobbed at the Aleppo neighborhood of al-Khalidiya. Health official Haj Taha later said the number of injured was up to 50, adding that symptoms suggested the gas used was chlorine. Further tests were needed, he said. State TV later said government troops retaliated, hitting the source of the attack. It didn't elaborate. Rebel commanders and opposition figures discredited the government reports, denying they lobbed gas into Aleppo. The opposition didn't have chemical weapons or the means to handle them, rebel commander Abdel-Salam Abdel-Razek said. On Twitter, he accused the government of staging the attack to frame the rebels. Rebel spokesman Musafa Sejari said the government was seeking to undermine the ceasefire. Fighting is continuing in various parts of the country. In the north-west, a ceasefire in Aleppo and neighboring Idlib has been fraying in recent days. On Saturday, Syrian regime shelling killed nine civilians, including seven children, in Idlib province - the last major rebel bastion in the country. A teacher and four schoolchildren were among the victims after the shelling hit near a school, the Observatory said. Meanwhile, in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, on the Iraqi border, counterattacks by the Islamic State group have killed at least 47 US-backed fighters over two days. The Observatory said the jihadists had launched ""three separate assaults"" on Saturday on Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The fighting on Saturday alone killed 29 SDF fighters, according to the Observatory, while 39 IS fighters were killed over the same period.",36.202104999999996,37.13426,90,2018-11-25T06:16:17Z,Asia/Damascus,CBRN - Middle-East - Syria,2018-11-25,disaster

465,disasters,US,"A faulty gasket at Croda's Atlas Point facility near New Castle, Delaware is what caused toxic, highly flammable ethylene oxide to leak out on Sunday afternoon, the company says. The wrong gasket was fitted on one of the pipes during construction of the plant, which opened in October 2017, Croda officials said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. That part failed Sunday causing the leak, which forced some nearby residents to shelter in their homes and the Delaware River and Bay Authority to shut down both sides of the bridge for more than six and a half hours causing massive traffic delays. ""We are sending the gasket to independent experts for analysis and confirmation. Our findings show that no other damage occurred to the ethylene oxide plant,"" the company said in the statement.

470,disasters,US,"The Phoenix Police Department's bomb squad is investigating a string of explosions that have rattled the nerves of residents in one Northwest Phoenix neighborhood. Neighbors have reported hearing more than a dozen explosions over the last couple of months, and some say the explosions they're hearing are happening at random times and random locations, within a five-mile radius of a neighborhood near 35th Avenue and Bell Road. Aside from the loud boom, the only evidence left behind are divots in the ground and a smell in the air. Exactly what the explosives are, and who's setting them off, remain a mystery. ""This is starting to get a little more out of hand,"" said Joe Bob Grisham. One of the explosives went off in front of his house a few days ago. The explosion left a shallow divot in the ground and propelled rocks into the air. ""We didn't see any shrapnel from a bomb casing or paper, but there were rocks everywhere,"" said Grisham. ""You can smell the sulfur on them from the explosion."" No one has been hurt, nor has anyone seen a possible suspect. Neighbors can only speculate about what is being blown up, and why. One resident, who did not want to appear on camera, has a theory. ""Since it's happening all different times of the day, it leads me to believe someone is playing around with explosives,"" said the woman. ""My husband is in the military.

Several more bus passengers were in a serious condition, reported Apple Daily. The injured have been sent to four hospitals around Hong Kong, with 37 people involved in the crash.

The cabbie reportedly had turned his hazard lights on, according to Yip. A passenger on the bus told the SCMP that the bus was going ""fast"" and ""didn't seem to slow down.""
